    ü•ë Summary Insights: Avocado Types
     üí° Key Observations

    - Organic avocados are consistently more expensive than their conventional counterparts.
        - Average Price (Organic): ~$1.65
        - Average Price (Conventional): ~$1.15

    - Conventional avocados dominate the market in terms of total volume.
        - They account for over 97% of total avocado volume sold.
        - This suggests that while organic avocados command higher prices, their market share remains niche.

     üì¶ Market Dynamics

    This divergence in volume vs. price reflects an interesting market pattern:
    - Consumers are willing to pay more for organic avocados, but
    - The majority of buyers opt for conventional due to availability and affordability.

     üìà Business Implication

    If you're a retailer:
    - Consider stocking a smaller, curated selection of organic avocados for premium customers.
    - But keep a robust supply of conventional avocados to satisfy mass demand.

    - üü¶ Conventional avocados
    - üü• Organic avocados

    Key insights:
    ‚Ä¢ Organic avocados consistently remained more expensive due to higher production costs and niche demand.
    ‚Ä¢ There was a noticeable price spike in mid-2017, likely due to seasonal or supply chain disruptions.
    ‚Ä¢ Toward late 2017, the price gap between organic and conventional avocados narrowed.
    ‚Ä¢ Both types of avocados generally show an upward trend, possibly driven by rising popularity and inflation.
